The Arcadia Throne War is a diceless, live-action roleplaying game system developed by Mark Slattery and Red Lhota. The system is currently in playtesting; we'd like to thank the members of [Dead City Productions](http://deadcityproductions.com/) at Northwestern University for their help.

The abilities of player characters aren't scores, but instead ranks that are determined during a live auction. The Auction System is used to facilitate this complicated and tense event. There are also plans to develop a rules website and character creation system, as well as a game management app for storytellers.

This auction system is currently under development by [Red Lhota](https://github.com/roseasromeo), [Korey Enright](https://github.com/korey-enright), and [Stephanie Marx](https://github.com/stephmarx).
